                 Brown rice is a healthier choice than white rice for most people due to brown rice's higher fiber, magnesium and zinc content.
                 the milling process converts brown rice to white rice. This process removes the bran and the germ as well as fiber, vitamins and minerals. meaning iron and some of the B-vitamins including thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and folic acid are added to white rice to boost the nutrient content.</br>
                 ->according to the USDA Food and Nutrient Database. Magnesium is a mineral important for bone health and helps you derive energy from the food you eat.</br>
